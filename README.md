# Greedy-walks-in-pursuit-of-laziness

This is my implementation of the bestGreedyPath and bestPath functions of 'Greedy walks in pursuit of laziness' the 2017 MATLAB project for ENGGEN 131 at The University of Auckland.

"This project requires you to write code that will allow you to find the best path from one side of a map to the other, where the map is represented as a 2D array containing elevation data. For our purposes the best path is deemed to be the one where a person moving from the west side of the map to the east (or vice versa) would experience the smallest total change in elevation as they move along that path (where any increase or decrease in elevation is interpreted as a positive change)."

Full details of the assignment can be found in GreedyWalkProjectAssignmentDetails.pdf

Although the assignment was fairly basic, I really enjoyed the final stage of optimising functions to get extra marks for speed.
Functions had to run in under 10 seconds in order to earn maximum marks. My greedy and non-greedy functions ran in 0.25 and 0.005 seconds on average respectively - the fastest in our year.
